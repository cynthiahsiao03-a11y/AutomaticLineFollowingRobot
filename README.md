<h1> Automatic Line Following Robot </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I designed and built an autonomous line-following robot using an Arduino microcontroller for real-time control and decision-making. I integrated an H-bridge motor driver to precisely regulate motor speed and direction, enabling smooth maneuverability and accurate path tracking.
To improve sensing performance, I modeled and fabricated a custom five-sensor mounting bracket in SolidWorks to ensure consistent alignment and responsiveness. I assembled the circuitry using precise soldering techniques and systematically debugged both the hardware and Arduino code to achieve reliable, consistent operation.
